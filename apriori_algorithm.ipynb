    "## Background\n",
    "Rule mining involves the process of discovering valuable association rules from data. Typically, these rules are expressed in the form of \"if-then\" conditions (e.g., \"if a customer purchases X, then they will purchase Y\"). These rules can be used to identify groups of products that are frequently ordered together, such as cake and candles, notebooks and pens, or bread and strawberry jam. The information gained from these rules can serve a variety of purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing order picking efficiency in a warehouse by placing commonly ordered items close to each other.\n",
    "- Providing customers with relevant recommendations based on their purchase history.\n",
    "- Offering strategic discounts or bundled deals based on frequently paired items.\n",
    "- Optimizing physical store product placement to increase cross-selling and improve the customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I used the apriori algorithm to determine the groups of items that are frequently ordered together and relevant metrics to measure the strength of each rule. The data used for this analysis was obtained from the Online Retail dataset, which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#. It corresponds to the sales made by a UK-based online retail store that sells unique all-occasion gifts."

    "## The Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Apriori algorithm** is a method used to efficiently identify association rules for frequently ordered groups of products. It achieves this by iteratively discarding products or groups of products that are not ordered enough to be relevant. This is accomplished by eliminating items and groups with low **support**, which is defined as the number of orders in which the item or group was included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of an association rule can be evaluated in various ways, but two of the most important measures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence**: This metric represents the percentage of orders in which the association rule is valid. For example, a statement like \"Product X leads to buying Product Y with 40% confidence\" would mean that 40% of orders that include X also contain Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lift**: This measurement indicates the increased likelihood that product Y will be in an order if product X is present. Suppose Y is in 10% of all orders and in 40% of orders containing X; in that case, the lift of our rule would be 0.4 / 0.1 = 4."
